# Luminis
Multi-tasks Discord bot made in discord.js by Neshell
## Prerequisites
### Node modules
Before using Luminis, you must have installed [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) on your computer. Next, inside Luminis folder, open a console and type
```
npm i
```
then wait until every node module is installed.
### Configuration
Now that node modules are installed, you should edit [config.sample.json](https://github.com/NeshellDev/Luminis/blob/master/config.sample.json) with your preferences and rename it 'config.json' (the original 'config.json' can always be used as a base).
### Token
Next, you must provide your bot's token in [config.json](https://github.com/NeshellDev/Luminis/blob/master/config.sample.json). Just change "your token here" by your token between quotes.
### Inviting & permissions
To invite Luminis on your server, just click here -> https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOT-ID-HERE&permissions=8&scope=bot ; just change the client ID. Luminis must have "Administrator" permission.
## Using
After installing correctly Luminis, just launch start.bat. You can have a list of every command by doing your prefix followed by "help" on your server.
